# Queue System Manager Project

## Overview
The Simulation Manager project is a Java-based application that simulates task scheduling across multiple servers using different strategies. The project utilizes the Strategy design pattern to allow for flexible and dynamic selection of scheduling algorithms. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, enabling users to configure and run simulations, and view results in real-time.

## Key Features
- ***Multiple Scheduling Strategies***: Implementations for shortest queue and shortest time strategies.
- ***Real-Time Simulation***: Visual representation of server queues and task processing.
- ***Configurable Parameters***: Users can set the number of servers, tasks, and other simulation parameters through the GUI.
- ***Detailed Results***: Displays average waiting time, average service time, and peak hour of the simulation.

## Getting Started
1. ***Clone the repository***:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/flaviamarincau/queue-system.git
    ```

## Documentation
For detailed information on how to use the application, configure simulations, and understand the results, please refer to the project documentation in the repo.
